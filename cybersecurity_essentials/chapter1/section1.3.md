Common Threats to End Users
===========================

As previously described, there are experts who are innovators and visionaries. They build the different cyber domains of the Internet. They have the capacity to recognize the power of data and harness it. Then they build their organizations and provide services, as well as protecting people from cyberattacks. Ideally, cybersecurity professionals should recognize the threat that data poses if it is used against people.

Threats and vulnerabilities are the main concern of cybersecurity professionals. Two situations are especially critical:

*   When a threat is the possibility that a harmful event, such as an attack, will occur.

*   When a vulnerability makes a target susceptible to an attack.

For example, data in the wrong hands can result in a loss of privacy for the owners, can affect their credit, or jeopardize their career or personal relationships. Identity theft is big business. However, it is not necessarily the Googles and Facebooks that pose the greatest risk. Schools, hospitals, financial institutions, government agencies, the workplace and e-commerce pose even greater risks. Organizations like Google and Facebook have the resources to hire top cybersecurity talent to protect their domains. As more organizations build large databases containing all of our personal data, the need for cybersecurity professionals increases. This leaves smaller businesses and organizations competing for the remaining pool of cybersecurity professionals. Cyber threats are particularly dangerous to certain industries and the records they must maintain.

Types of Personal Records
=========================

The following examples are just a few sources of data that can come from established organizations.

**Medical Records**

Going to the doctor’s office results in the addition of more information to an electronic health record (EHR). The prescription from a family doctor becomes part of the EHR. An EHR includes physical health, mental health, and other personal information that may not be medically related. For example, an individual goes to counseling as a child because of major changes in the family. This will be somewhere in his or her medical records. Besides the medical history and personal information, the EHR may also include information about that person’s family. Several laws address protecting patient records.

Medical devices, such as fitness bands, use the cloud platform to enable wireless transfer, storage and display of clinical data like heart rates, blood pressures and blood sugars. These devices can generate an enormous amount of clinical data that can become part of a medical record.

**Education Records**

Education records include information about grades, test scores, attendance, courses taken, awards, degrees awarded, and disciplinary reports. This record may also include contact information, health and immunization records, and special education records, including individualized education programs (IEPs).

**Employment and Financial Records**

Employment information can include past employment and performance. Employment records can also include salary and insurance information. Financial records may include information about income and expenditures. Tax records could include paycheck stubs, credit card statements, credit rating and banking information.

Threats to Internet Services
============================

There are many essential technical services needed for a network, and ultimately the Internet, to operate. These services include routing, addressing, domain naming, and database management. These services also serve as prime targets for cyber criminals.

Criminals use packet-sniffing tools to capture data streams over a network. This means that all sensitive data, like usernames, passwords and credit card numbers, are at risk. Packet sniffers work by monitoring and recording all information coming across a network. Criminals can also use rogue devices, such as unsecured Wi-Fi access points. If the criminal sets this up near a public place, such as a coffee shop, unsuspecting individuals may sign on and the packet sniffer copies their personal information.

Domain Name Service (DNS) translates a domain name, such as www.facebook.com, into its numerical IP address. If a DNS server does not know the IP address, it will ask another DNS server. With DNS spoofing (or DNS cache poisoning), the criminal introduces false data into a DNS resolver’s cache. These poison attacks exploit a weakness in the DNS software that causes the DNS servers to redirect traffic for a specific domain to the criminal’s computer, instead of the legitimate owner of the domain.

Packets transport data across a network or the Internet. Packet forgery (or packet injection) interferes with an established network communication by constructing packets to appear as if they are part of a communication. Packet forgery allows a criminal to disrupt or intercept packets. This process enables the criminal to hijack an authorized connection or denies an individual’s ability to use certain network services. Cyber professionals call this a man-in-the-middle attack.

The examples given only scratch the surface of the types of threats criminals can launch against Internet and network services.

Threats to Key Industry Sectors
===============================

Key industry sectors offer networking infrastructure systems such as manufacturing, energy, communication and transportation. For example, the smart grid is an enhancement to the electrical generation and distribution system. The electrical grid carries power from central generators to a large number of customers. A smart grid uses information to create an automated advanced energy delivery network. World leaders recognize that protecting their infrastructure is critical to protecting their economy.

Over the last decade, cyberattacks like Stuxnet proved that a cyberattack could successfully destroy or interrupt critical infrastructures. Specifically, the Stuxnet attack targeted the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system used to control and monitor industrial processes. SCADA can be part of various industrial processes in manufacturing, production, energy and communications systems.

A cyberattack could bring down or interrupt industry sectors like telecommunication, transportation or electrical power generation and distribution systems. It could also interrupt the financial services sector. One of the problems with environments that incorporate SCADA is the fact that designers did not connect SCADA to the traditional IT environment and the Internet. Therefore, they did not properly consider cybersecurity during the development phase of these systems. Like other industries, organizations using SCADA systems recognize the value of data collection to improve operations and decrease costs. The resulting trend is to connect SCADA systems to traditional IT systems. However, this increases the vulnerability of industries using SCADA systems.

The advanced threat potential that exists today demands a special breed of cyber security experts.

Threats to People’s Way of Life
===============================

Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect networked systems and data from unauthorized access. On a personal level, everyone needs to safeguard his or her identity, data, and computing devices. At the corporate level, it is the employees’ responsibility to protect the organization’s reputation, data, and customers. At the state level, national security and the citizens’ safety and well-being are at stake.

Cybersecurity professionals are often involved in working with government agencies in identifying and collecting data.

In the U.S., the National Security Agency (NSA) is responsible for intelligence collection and surveillance activities. The NSA built a new data center just to process the growing volume of information. In 2015, the U.S. Congress passed the USA Freedom Act ending the practice of collecting U.S. Citizens’ phone records in bulk. The program provided metadata that gave the NSA information about communications sent and received.

The efforts to protect people’s way of life often conflicts with their right to privacy. It will be interesting to see what happens to the balance between these rights and the safety of Internet users.
