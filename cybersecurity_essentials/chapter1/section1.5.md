Addressing the Shortage of Cybersecurity Specialists
====================================================

In the U.S., the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) created a framework for companies and organizations in need of cybersecurity professionals. The framework enables companies to identify the major types of responsibilities, job titles, and workforce skills needed. The National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework categorizes and describes cybersecurity work. It provides a common language that defines cybersecurity work along with a common set of tasks and skills required to become a cybersecurity specialist. The framework helps to define professional requirements in cybersecurity.

The National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework
==============================================

The Workforce Framework categorizes cybersecurity work into seven categories.

**Operate and Maintain** includes providing the support, administration, and maintenance required to ensure IT system performance and security.

**Protect and Defend** includes the identification, analysis, and mitigation of threats to internal systems and networks.

**Investigate** includes the investigation of cyber events and/or cyber crimes involving IT resources.

**Collect and Operate** includes specialized denial and deception operations and the collection of cybersecurity information.

**Analyze** includes highly specialized review and evaluation of incoming cybersecurity information to determine if it is useful for intelligence.

**Oversight and Development** provides for leadership, management, and direction to conduct cybersecurity work effectively.

**Securely Provision** includes conceptualizing, designing, and building secure IT systems.

Within each category, there are several specialty areas. The specialty areas then define common types of cybersecurity work.

The figure displays each of the categories and a brief description of each.

Professional Organizations
==========================

Cybersecurity specialists must collaborate with professional colleagues frequently. International technology organizations often sponsor workshops and conferences. These organizations often keep cybersecurity professionals inspired and motivated.

Cybersecurity Student Organizations and Competitions
====================================================

Cybersecurity specialists must have the same skills as hackers, especially black hat hackers, in order to protect against attacks. How can an individual build and practice the skills necessary to become a cybersecurity specialist? Student skills competitions are a great way to build cybersecurity knowledge skills and abilities. There are many national cybersecurity skills competitions available to cybersecurity students.

Industry Certifications
=======================

In a world of cybersecurity threats, there is a great need for skilled and knowledgeable information security professionals. The IT industry established standards for cybersecurity specialists to obtain professional certifications that provide proof of skills, and knowledge level.

**CompTIA Security+**

Security+ is a CompTIA-sponsored testing program that certifies the competency of IT administrators in information assurance. The Security+ test covers the most important principles for securing a network and managing risk, including concerns associated with cloud computing.

**EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)**

This intermediate-level certification asserts that cybersecurity specialists holding this credential possess the skills and knowledge for various hacking practices. These cybersecurity specialists use the same skills and techniques used by the cyber criminals to identify system vulnerabilities and access points into systems.

**SANS GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC)**

The GSEC certification is a good choice for an entry-level credential for cybersecurity specialists who can demonstrate that they understand security terminology and concepts and have the skills and expertise required for “hands-on” security roles. The SANS GIAC program offers a number of additional certifications in the fields of security administration, forensics, and auditing.

**(ISC)^2** **Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)**

The CISSP certification is a vendor-neutral certification for those cybersecurity specialists with a great deal of technical and managerial experience. It is also formally approved by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and is a globally recognized industry certification in the security field.

**ISACA Certified Information Security Manager (CISM)**

Cyber heroes responsible for managing, developing and overseeing information security systems at the enterprise level or for those developing best security practices can qualify for CISM. Credential holders possess advanced skills in security risk management.

Company-Sponsored Certifications
================================

Another important credential for cybersecurity specialists are company-sponsored certifications. These certifications measure knowledge and competency in installing, configuring, and maintaining vendor products. Cisco and Microsoft are examples of companies with certifications that test knowledge of their products.

**Cisco Certified Network Associate Security (CCNA Security)**

The CCNA Security certification validates that a cybersecurity specialist has the knowledge and skills required to secure Cisco networks.

How to Become a Cybersecurity Expert
====================================

To become a successful cybersecurity specialist, the potential candidate should look at some of the unique requirements. Heroes must be able to respond to threats as soon as they occur. This means that the working hours can be somewhat unconventional.

Cyber heroes also analyze policy, trends, and intelligence to understand how cyber criminals think. Many times, this may involve a large amount of detective work.

The following recommendations will help aspiring cybersecurity specialists to achieve their goals:

*   **Study**: Learn the basics by completing courses in IT. Be a life-long learner. Cybersecurity is an ever-changing field, and cybersecurity specialists must keep up.

*   **Pursue Certifications**: Industry and company sponsored certifications from organizations such as Microsoft and Cisco prove that one possesses the knowledge needed to seek employment as a cybersecurity specialist.

*   **Pursue Internships**: Seeking out a security internship as a student can lead to opportunities down the road.

*   **Join Professional Organizations**: Join computer security organizations, attend meetings and conferences, and join forums and blogs to gain knowledge from the experts.
