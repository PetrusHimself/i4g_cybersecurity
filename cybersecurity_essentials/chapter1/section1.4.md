Internal and External Threats
=============================

**Internal Security Threats**

Attacks can originate from within an organization or from outside of the organization, as shown in the figure. An internal user, such as an employee or contract partner, can accidently or intentionally:

*   Mishandle confidential data

*   Threaten the operations of internal servers or network infrastructure devices

*   Facilitate outside attacks by connecting infected USB media into the corporate computer system

*   Accidentally invite malware onto the network through malicious email or websites

Internal threats have the potential to cause greater damage than external threats because internal users have direct access to the building and its infrastructure devices. Internal attackers typically have knowledge of the corporate network, its resources, and its confidential data. They may also have knowledge of security countermeasures, policies and higher levels of administrative privileges.

**External Security Threats**

External threats from amateurs or skilled attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in networked devices, or can use social engineering, such as trickery, to gain access. External attacks exploit weaknesses or vulnerabilities to gain access to internal resources.

**Traditional Data**

Corporate data includes personnel information, intellectual property, and financial data. Personnel information includes application materials, payroll, offer letters, employee agreements, and any information used in making employment decisions. Intellectual property, such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, allows a business to gain economic advantage over its competitors. Consider this intellectual property as a trade secret; losing this information can be disastrous for the future of the company. Financial data, such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements, gives insight into the health of the company.

The Vulnerabilities of Mobile Devices
=====================================

In the past, employees typically used company-issued computers connected to a corporate LAN. Administrators continuously monitor and update these computers to meet security requirements. Today, mobile devices such as iPhones, smartphones, tablets, and thousands of other devices, are becoming powerful substitutes for, or additions to, the traditional PC. More and more people are using these devices to access enterprise information. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is a growing trend. The inability to centrally manage and update mobile devices poses a growing threat to organizations that allow employee mobile devices on their networks.

The Emergence of the Internet of Things
=======================================

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the collection of technologies that enable the connection of various devices to the Internet. The technological evolution associated with the advent of the IoT is changing commercial and consumer environments. IoT technologies enable people to connect billions of devices to the Internet. These devices include appliances, locks, motors, and entertainment devices, to name just a few. This technology affects the amount of data that needs protection. Users access these devices remotely, which increases the number of networks requiring protection.

With the emergence of IoT, there is much more data to be managed and secured. All of these connections, plus the expanded storage capacity and storage services offered through the Cloud and virtualization, has led to the exponential growth of data. This data expansion created a new area of interest in technology and business called “Big Data".

The Impact of Big Data
======================

Big data is the result of data sets that are large and complex, making traditional data processing applications inadequate. Big data poses both challenges and opportunities based on three dimensions:

*   The volume or amount of data

*   The velocity or speed of data

*   The variety or range of data types and sources

There are numerous examples of big corporate hacks in the news. Companies like Target, Home Depot and PayPal are subjects of highly publicized attacks. As a result, enterprise systems require dramatic changes in security product designs and substantial upgrades to technologies and practices. Additionally, governments and industries are introducing more regulations and mandates that require better data protection and security controls to help guard big data.

Using Advanced Weapons
======================

Software vulnerabilities today rely on programming mistakes, protocol vulnerabilities, or system misconfigurations. The cyber criminal merely has to exploit one of these. For example, a common attack involved constructing an input to a program in order to sabotage the program, making it malfunction. This malfunction provided a doorway into the program or caused it to leak information.

There is a growing sophistication seen in cyberattacks today. An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a continuous computer hack that occurs under the radar against a specific object. Criminals usually choose an APT for business or political motives. An APT occurs over a long period with a high degree of secrecy using sophisticated malware.

Algorithm attacks can track system self-reporting data, like how much energy a computer is using, and use that information to select targets or trigger false alerts. Algorithmic attacks can also disable a computer by forcing it to use memory or by overworking its central processing unit. Algorithmic attacks are more devious because they exploit designs used to improve energy savings, decrease system failures, and improve efficiencies.

Finally, the new generation of attacks involves intelligent selection of victims. In the past, attacks would select the low hanging fruit or most vulnerable victims. However, with greater attention to detection and isolation of cyberattacks, cyber criminals must be more careful. They cannot risk early detection or the cybersecurity specialists will close the gates of the castle. As a result, many of the more sophisticated attacks will only launch if the attacker can match the object signature targeted.

Broader Scope and Cascade Effect
================================

Federated identity management refers to multiple enterprises that let their users use the same identification credentials gaining access to the networks of all enterprises in the group. This broadens the scope and increases the probability of a cascading effect should an attack occur.

A federated identity links a subject’s electronic identity across separate identity management systems. For example, a subject may be able to log onto Yahoo! with Google or Facebook credentials. This is an example of social login.

The goal of federated identity management is to share identity information automatically across castle boundaries. From the individual user’s perspective, this means a single sign-on to the web.

It is imperative that organizations scrutinize the identifying information shared with partners. Social security numbers, names, and addresses may allow identity thieves the opportunity to steal this information from a partner to perpetrate fraud. The most common way to protect federated identity is to tie login ability to an authorized device.

Safety Implications
===================

Emergency call centers in the U.S. are vulnerable to cyberattacks that could shut down 911 networks, jeopardizing public safety. A telephone denial of service (TDoS) attack uses phone calls against a target telephone network tying up the system and preventing legitimate calls from getting through. Next generation 911 call centers are vulnerable because they use Voice-over-IP (VoIP) systems rather than traditional landlines. In addition to TDoS attacks, these call centers can also be at risk of distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that use many systems to flood the resources of the target making the target unavailable to legitimate users. There are many ways nowadays to request 911 help, from using an app on a smartphone to using a home security system.

Heightened Recognition of Cybersecurity Threats
===============================================

The defenses against cyberattacks at the start of the cyber era were low. A smart high school student or script kiddie could gain access to systems. Countries across the world have become more aware of the threat of cyberattacks. The threat posed by cyberattacks now head the list of greatest threats to national and economic security in most countries.
