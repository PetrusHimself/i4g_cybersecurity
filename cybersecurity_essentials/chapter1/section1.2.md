Who Are the Cyber Criminals?
============================

In the early years of the cybersecurity world, the typical cyber criminals were teenagers or hobbyists operating from a home PC, with attacks mostly limited to pranks and vandalism. Today, the world of the cyber criminals has become more dangerous. Attackers are individuals or groups who attempt to exploit vulnerabilities for personal or financial gain. Cyber criminals are interested in everything from credit cards to product designs, and anything with value.

**Amateurs**

Amateurs, or script kiddies, have little or no skill, often using existing tools or instructions found on the Internet to launch attacks. Some are just curious, while others try to demonstrate their skills and cause harm. They may be using basic tools, but the results can still be devastating.

**Hackers**

This group of criminals breaks into computers or networks to gain access for various reasons. The intent of the break-in determines the classification of these attackers as white, gray, or black hats. White hat attackers break into networks or computer systems to discover weaknesses in order to improve the security of these systems. The owners of the system give permission to perform the break-in, and they receive the results of the test. On the other hand, black hat attackers take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain. Gray hat attackers are somewhere between white and black hat attackers. The gray hat attackers may find a vulnerability and report it to the owners of the system if that action coincides with their agenda. Some gray hat hackers publish the facts about the vulnerability on the Internet, so that other attackers can exploit it.

The figure gives details about the terms white hat hacker, black hat hacker, and gray hat hacker.

**Organized Hackers**

These criminals include organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists, and state-sponsored hackers. Cyber criminals are usually groups of professional criminals focused on control, power, and wealth. The criminals are highly sophisticated and organized, and may even provide cybercrime as a service. Hacktivists make political statements to create awareness to issues that are important to them. Hacktivists publically publish embarrassing information about their victims. State-sponsored attackers gather intelligence or commit sabotage on behalf of their government. These attackers are usually highly trained and well-funded. Their attacks focus on specific goals that are beneficial to their government. Some state-sponsored attackers are even members of their nations’ armed forces.

Cyber Criminal Motives
======================

Cyber criminal profiles and motives have changed over the years. Hacking started in the ‘60s with phone freaking (or phreaking) which refers to using various audio frequencies to manipulate phone systems. In the mid-‘80s, criminals used computer dial-up modems to connect computers to networks and used password-cracking programs to gain access to data. Nowadays, criminals are going beyond just stealing information. Criminals can now use malware and viruses as high tech weapons. However, the greatest motivation for most cyber criminals is financial. Cybercrime has become more lucrative than the illegal drug trade.

General hacker profiles and motives have changed quite a bit. The figure displays modern hacking terms and a brief description of each.

Why Become a Cybersecurity Specialist?
======================================

The demand for cybersecurity specialists has grown more than the demand for other IT jobs. All of the technology that transforms the kingdom and improves people’s way of life also makes it more vulnerable to attacks. Technology alone cannot prevent, detect, respond and recover from cybersecurity incidents. Consider the following:

*   The skill level required for an effective cybersecurity specialist and the shortage of qualified cybersecurity professionals translates to higher earning potential.

*   Information technology is constantly changing. This is also true for cybersecurity. The highly dynamic nature of the cybersecurity field can be challenging and fascinating.

*   A cybersecurity specialist’s career is also highly portable. Jobs exist in almost every geographic location.

*   Cybersecurity specialists provide a necessary service to their organizations, countries, and societies, very much like law enforcement or emergency responders.

Becoming a cybersecurity specialist is a rewarding career opportunity.

Thwarting Cyber Criminals
=========================

Thwarting the cyber criminals is a difficult task and there is no such thing as a “silver bullet.” However, company, government and international organizations have begun to take coordinated actions to limit or fend off cyber criminals. The coordinated actions include:

*   Creating comprehensive databases of known system vulnerabilities and attack signatures (a unique arrangement of information used to identify an attacker’s attempt to exploit a known vulnerability). Organizations share these databases worldwide to help prepare for and fend off many common attacks.

*   Establishing early warning sensors and alert networks. Due to cost and the impossibility of monitoring every network, organizations monitor high-value targets or create imposters that look like high-value targets. Because these high-value targets are more likely to experience attacks, they warn others of potential attacks.

*   Sharing cyber intelligence information. Business, government agencies and countries now collaborate to share critical information about serious attacks to critical targets in order to prevent similar attacks in other places. Many countries have established cyber intelligence agencies to collaborate worldwide in combating major cyberattacks.

*   Establishing information security management standards among national and international organizations. The ISO 27000 is a good example of these international efforts.

*   Enacting new laws to discourage cyberattacks and data breaches. These laws have severe penalties to punish cyber criminals caught carrying out illegal actions.
