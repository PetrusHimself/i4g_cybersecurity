Types of Data Storage
=====================

Stored data refers to data at rest. Data at rest means that a type of storage device retains the data when no user or process is using it. A storage device can be local (on a computing device) or centralized (on the network). A number of options exist for storing data.

Direct-attached storage (DAS) is storage connected to a computer. A hard drive or USB flash drive is an example of direct-attached storage. By default, systems are not set up to share direct-attached storage.

Redundant array of independent disks (RAID) uses multiple hard drives in an array, which is a method of combining multiple disks so that the operating system sees them as a single disk. RAID provides improved performance and fault tolerance.

A network attached storage (NAS) device is a storage device connected to a network that allows storage and retrieval of data from a centralized location by authorized network users. NAS devices are flexible and scalable, meaning administrators can increase the capacity as needed.

A storage area network (SAN) architecture is a network based storage system. SAN systems connect to the network using high-speed interfaces allowing improved performance and the ability to connect multiple servers to a centralized disk storage repository.

Cloud storage is a remote storage option that uses space on a data center provider and is accessible from any computer with Internet access. Google Drive, iCloud, and Dropbox are all examples of cloud storage providers.

Challenges of Protecting Stored Data
====================================

Organizations have a challenging task in trying to protect stored data. In order to improve data storage, organizations can automate and centralize data backups.

Direct-attached storage can be one of the most difficult types of data storage to manage and control. Direct-attached storage is vulnerable to malicious attacks on the local host. Stored data may also include backup data. Backups can be manual or automatic. Organizations should limit the types of data stored on direct-attached storage. In particular, an organization would not store critical data on direct-attached storage devices.

Network storage systems offer a more secure option. Network storage systems including RAID, SAN and NAS provide greater performance and redundancy. However, network storage systems are more complicated to configure and manage. They also handle more data, posing a greater risk to the organization if the device fails. The unique challenges of network storage systems include configuring, testing, and monitoring the system.

Methods of Transmitting Data
============================

Data transmission involves sending information from one device to another. There are numerous methods to transmit information between devices including:

*   **Sneaker net** – uses removable media to physically move data from one computer to another

*   **Wired networks** – uses cables to transmit data

*   **Wireless networks** – uses radio waves to transmit data

Organizations will never be able to eliminate the use of a sneaker net.

Wired networks include copper-wired and fiber optic media. Wired networks can serve a local geographical area (Local Area Network) or they can span great distances (Wide Area Networks).

Wireless networks are replacing wired networks. Wireless networks are becoming faster and able to handle more bandwidth. Wireless networks expand the number of guest users with mobile devices on small office home office (SOHO) and enterprise networks.

Both wired and wireless networks use packets or data units. The term packet refers to a unit of data that travels between an origin and a destination on the network. Standard protocols like Internet Protocol (IP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) define the structure and formation of data packets. These standards are open source and are available to the public. Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of transmitted data is one of the most important responsibilities of a cybersecurity professional.

Challenges of Protecting Data In-Transit
========================================

The protection of transmitted data is one of the most challenging jobs of a cybersecurity professional. With the growth in mobile and wireless devices, cybersecurity professionals are responsible for protecting massive amounts of data crossing their network on a daily basis. The cybersecurity professional must deal with several challenges in protecting this data:

*   **Protecting data confidentiality** – cyber criminals can capture, save and steal data in-transit. Cyber professionals must take steps to counter these actions.

*   **Protecting data integrity** – cyber criminals can intercept and alter data in-transit. Cybersecurity professionals deploy data integrity systems that test the integrity and authenticity of transmitted data to counter these actions.

*   **Protecting data availability** - cyber criminals can use rogue or unauthorized devices to interrupt data availability. A simple mobile device can pose as a local wireless access point and trick unsuspecting users into associating with the rogue device. The cybercriminal can hijack an authorized connection to a protected service or device. Network security professionals can implement mutual-authentication systems to counter these actions. Mutual-authentication systems require the user to authenticate to the server, and requests the server to authenticate to the user.

Forms of Data Processing and Computation
========================================

The third state of data is data in process. This refers to data during initial input, modification, computation, or output.

Protection of data integrity starts with the initial input of data. Organizations use several methods to collect data, such as manual data entry, scanning forms, file uploads, and data collected from sensors. Each of these methods pose potential threats to data integrity. An example of data corruption during the input process includes data entry errors or disconnected, malfunctioning, or inoperable system sensors. Other examples can include mislabeling and incorrect or mismatched data formats.

Data modification refers to any changes to the original data such as users manually modifying data, programs processing and changing data, and equipment failing resulting in data modification. Processes like encoding/decoding, compression/decompression and encryption/decryption are all examples of data modification. Malicious code also results in data corruption.

Data corruption also occurs during the data output process. Data output refers to outputting data to printers, electronic displays or directly to other devices. The accuracy of output data is critical because output provides information and influences decision-making. Examples of output data corruption include the incorrect use of data delimiters, incorrect communication configurations, and improperly configured printers.

Challenges of Protecting Data In-Process
========================================

Protecting against invalid data modification during processing can have an adverse impact. Software errors are the reason for many mishaps and disasters. For example, just two weeks before Christmas, some of Amazon’s third-party retailers experienced a change in the advertised price on their items to just one cent. The glitch lasted for one hour. The error resulted in thousands of shoppers getting the deal of a lifetime and the company losing revenue. In 2016, the Nest thermostat malfunctioned and left users with no heat. The Nest thermostat is a smart technology owned by Google. A software glitch left users, literally, out in the cold. A software update went wrong, forcing the device’s batteries to drain and leaving it unable to control temperature. As a result, customers were unable to heat their homes or get hot water on one of the coldest weekends of the year.

Protecting data during processing requires well-designed systems. Cybersecurity professionals design policies and procedures that require testing, maintaining, and updating systems to keep them operating with the least amount of errors.
