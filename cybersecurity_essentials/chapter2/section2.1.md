The Principles of Security
==========================

The first dimension of the cybersecurity cube identifies the goals to protect cyberspace. The goals identified in the first dimension are the foundational principles. These three principles are confidentiality, integrity and availability. The principles provide focus and enable the cybersecurity expert to prioritize actions when protecting any networked system.

Confidentiality prevents the disclosure of information to unauthorized people, resources, or processes. Integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data. Finally, availability ensures that information is accessible by authorized users when needed. Use the acronym CIA to remember these three principles.

The States of Data
==================

Cyberspace is a domain containing a considerable amount of critically important data; therefore, cybersecurity experts focus on protecting data. The second dimension of the Cybersecurity Cube focuses on the problems of protecting all of the states of data in cyberspace. Data has three possible states:

*   Data in transit

*   Data at rest or in storage

*   Data in process

The protection of cyberspace requires cybersecurity professionals to account for the safeguarding of data in all three states.

Cybersecurity Safeguards
========================

The third dimension of the Cybersecurity Cube defines the skills and discipline a cybersecurity professional can call upon to protect cyberspace. Cybersecurity professionals must use a range of different skills and disciplines available to them when protecting the data in the cyberspace. They must do this while remaining on the ‘right side’ of the law.

The Cybersecurity Cube identifies the three types of skills and disciplines used to provide protection. The first skill includes the technologies, devices, and products available to protect information systems and fend off cyber criminals. Cybersecurity professionals have a reputation for mastering the technological tools at their disposal. However, McCumber reminds them that the technological tools are not enough to defeat cyber criminals. Cybersecurity professionals must also build a strong defense by establishing policies, procedures, and guidelines that enable the users of cyberspace to stay safe and follow good practices. Finally, users of cyberspace must strive to become more knowledgeable about the threats of the cyberspace and establish a culture of learning and awareness.
