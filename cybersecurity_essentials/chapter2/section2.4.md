Software-based Technology Safeguards
====================================

Software safeguards include programs and services that protect operating systems, databases, and other services operating on workstations, portable devices, and servers. Administrators install software-based countermeasures or safeguards on individual hosts or servers. There are several software-based technologies used to safeguard an organization’s assets:

*   Software firewalls control remote access to a system. Operating systems typically include a firewall or a user can purchase or download software from a third party.

*   Network and port scanners discover and monitor open ports on a host or server.

*   Protocol analyzers, or signature analyzers, are devices that collect and examine network traffic. They identify performance problems, detect misconfigurations, identify misbehaving applications, establish baseline and normal traffic patterns, and debug communication problems.

*   Vulnerability scanners are computer programs designed to assess weaknesses on computers or networks.

*   Host-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) examine activity on host systems only. An IDS generates log files and alarm messages when it detects unusual activity. A system storing sensitive data or providing critical services is a candidate for host-based IDS.

Hardware-based Technology Safeguards
====================================

There are several hardware-based technologies used to safeguard an organization’s assets:

*   Firewall appliances block unwanted traffic. Firewalls contain rules that define the traffic allowed into and out of a network.

*   Dedicated Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect signs of attacks or unusual traffic on a network and send an alert.

*   Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) detect signs of attacks or unusual traffic on a network, generate an alert and take corrective actions.

*   Content filtering services control access and transmission of objectionable or offensive content.

Network-based Technology Safeguards
===================================

There are several network-based technologies used to protect the organization’s assets:

*   **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** is a secure virtual network that uses the public network (i.e., the Internet). The security of a VPN lies in the encryption of packet content between the endpoints that define the VPN.

*   **Network access control (NAC)** requires a set of checks before allowing a device to connect to a network. Some common checks include up-to-data antivirus software or operating system updates installed.

*   **Wireless access point security** includes the implementation of authentication and encryption.

Cloud-based Technology Safeguards
=================================

Cloud-based technologies shift the technology component from the organization to the cloud provider. The three main cloud computing services include:

*   **Software as a Service (SaaS)** allows users to gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure. Users store data on the cloud provider’s servers.

*   **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet. The provider hosts the hardware, software, servers, and storage components.

*   **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** provides access to the development tools and services used to deliver the applications.

Cloud service providers have extended these options to include IT as a Service (ITaaS), which provides IT support for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS service models. In the ITaaS model, an organization contracts with the Cloud provider for individual or bundled services.

Cloud service providers use virtual security appliances that run inside a virtual environment with a pre-packaged, hardened operating system running on virtualized hardware.

Implementing Cybersecurity Education and Training
=================================================

Investing a lot of money in technology will not make a difference if the people within the organization are the weakest link in cybersecurity. A security awareness program is extremely important for an organization. An employee may not be purposefully malicious but just unaware of what the proper procedures are. There are several ways to implement a formal training program:

*   Make security awareness training a part of the employee’s onboarding process

*   Tie security awareness to job requirements or performance evaluations

*   Conduct in-person training sessions

*   Complete online courses

Security awareness should be an ongoing process since new threats and techniques are always on the horizon.

Establishing a Culture of Cybersecurity Awareness
=================================================

The members of an organization must be aware of security policies and have the knowledge to make security part of their day-to-day activities.

An active security awareness program depends on:

*   The organization's environment

*   The level of threat

The creation of a cybersecurity awareness culture is an ongoing effort that requires the leadership of upper management and the commitment of all users and employees. Affecting the cybersecurity culture of an organization starts with the establishment of policies and procedures by management. For example, many organizations have cybersecurity awareness days. Organizations can also post banners and signage to increase overall cybersecurity awareness. The creation of cybersecurity orientation workshops and seminars help to increase awareness.

Policies
========

A security policy is a set of security objectives for a company that includes rules of behavior for users and administrators and specifies system requirements. These objectives, rules, and requirements collectively ensure the security of a network, the data, and the computer systems within an organization.

A comprehensive security policy accomplishes several tasks:

*   It demonstrates an organization’s commitment to security.

*   It sets the rules for expected behavior.

*   It ensures consistency in system operations, software and hardware acquisition and use, and maintenance.

*   It defines the legal consequences of violations.

*   It gives security staff the backing of management.

Security policies inform users, staff, and managers of an organization’s requirements for protecting technology and information assets. A security policy also specifies the mechanisms needed to meet security requirements.

As shown in the figure, a security policy typically includes:

*   **Identification and authentication policies -** Specifies authorized persons that can have access to network resources and outlines verification procedures.

*   **Password policies -** Ensures passwords meet minimum requirements and are changed regularly.

*   **Acceptable use policies -** Identifies network resources and usage that are acceptable to the organization. It may also identify ramifications for policy violations.

*   **Remote access policies -** Identifies how remote users can access a network and what is remotely accessible.

*   **Network maintenance policies -** Specifies network device operating systems and end user application update procedures.

*   **Incident handling policies -** Describes how security incidents are handled.

One of the most common security policy components is an acceptable use policy (AUP). This component defines what users can and cannot do on the various system components. The AUP should be as explicit as possible to avoid misunderstanding. For example, an AUP lists specific websites, newsgroups, or bandwidth intensive applications that users cannot access using company computers or the company network.

Standards
=========

Standards help an IT staff maintain consistency in operating the network. Standards documents provide the technologies that specific users or programs need in addition to any program requirements or criteria that an organization must follow. This helps IT staff improve efficiency and simplicity in design, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

One of the most important security principles is consistency. For this reason, it is necessary for organizations to establish standards. Each organization develops standards to support its unique operating environment. For example, an organization establishes a password policy. The standard is that passwords require a minimum of eight upper and lowercase alphanumeric characters, including at least one special character. A user must change a password every 30 days, and a password history of 12 previous passwords ensures that the user creates unique passwords for one year.

Guidelines
==========

Guidelines are a list of suggestions on how to do things more efficiently and securely. They are similar to standards, but are more flexible and are not usually mandatory. Guidelines define how standards are developed and guarantee adherence to general security policies.

Some of the most helpful guidelines make up an organization’s best practices. In addition to an organization’s defined best practices, guidelines are also available from the following:

*   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Computer Security Resource Center (Figure 1)

*   National Security Agency (NSA) Security Configuration Guides (Figure 2)

*   The Common Criteria standard (Figure 3)

Using the password policy example, a guideline is a suggestion that the user take a phrase like "I have a dream" and convert it to a strong password, Ihv@dr3@m. The user can create other passwords from this phrase by changing the number, moving the symbol, or changing the punctuation mark.

Procedures
==========

Procedure documents are longer and more detailed than standards and guidelines. Procedure documents include implementation details that usually contain step-by-step instructions and graphics.

The figure shows an example of the procedure used to change a password. Large organizations must use procedure documents to maintain the consistency of deployment that is necessary for a secure environment.
