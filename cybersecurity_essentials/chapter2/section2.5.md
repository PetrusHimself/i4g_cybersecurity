Overview of the Model
=====================

Security professionals need to secure information from end-to-end within the organization. This is a monumental task, and it is unreasonable to expect one individual to have all of the requisite knowledge. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) developed a comprehensive framework to guide information security management. The ISO/IEC cybersecurity model is to cybersecurity professionals what the OSI networking model is to network engineers. Both provide a framework for understanding and approaching complex tasks.

Cybersecurity Domains
=====================

ISO/IEC 27000 is an information security standard published in 2005 and revised in 2013. ISO publishes the ISO 27000 standards. Even though the standards are not mandatory, most countries use them as a de facto framework for implementing information security.

The ISO 27000 standards describe the implementation of a comprehensive information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS consists of all of the administrative, technical and operational controls to keep information safe within an organization. Twelve independent domains represent the components of the ISO 27000 standard. These twelve domains serve to organize, at a high level, the vast areas of information under the umbrella of information security.

The structure of the ISO cybersecurity model is different from the OSI model in that it uses domains rather than layers to describe the categories for security. The reason for this is that the ISO cybersecurity model is not a hierarchical relationship. It is a peer model in which each domain has a direct relationship with the other domains. The ISO 27000 cybersecurity model is very similar to the OSI model in that it is vital for cybersecurity specialists to understand both of these models to be successful.

The twelve domains serve as a common basis for developing organizational security standards and effective security management practices. They also help to facilitate communication between organizations.

Control Objectives
==================

The twelve domains consist of control objectives defined in the 27001 part of the standard. The control objectives define the high-level requirements to implement a comprehensive ISM. An organization’s management team uses the ISO 27001 control objectives to define and publish the organization’s security policies. Control objectives provide a checklist to use during security management audits. Many organizations need to pass an ISMS audit in order to earn a designation of ISO 27001 compliant.

Certification and compliance provide confidence for two organizations that need to trust each other’s confidential data and operations. Compliance and security audits prove that organizations are continuously improving their information security management system.

The following is an example of a control objective:

_To control access to networks by using the appropriate authentication mechanisms for users and equipment._

Controls
========

The ISO/IEC 27002 defines information security management system controls. Controls are more detailed than objectives. Control objectives tell the organization what to do. Controls define how to accomplish the objective.

Based on the control objective, to control access to networks by using the appropriate authentication mechanisms for users and equipment, the control would be:

_Use strong passwords. A strong password consists of at least eight characters that are a combination of letters, numbers and symbols (@, #, $, %, etc.) if allowed. Passwords are case-sensitive, so a strong password contains letters in both uppercase and lowercase._

Cybersecurity professionals recognize the following:

*   Controls are not mandatory, but they are widely accepted and adopted.

*   Controls must maintain vendor-neutrality to avoid the appearance of endorsing a specific product or company.

*   Controls are like guidelines. This means that there can be more than one way to comply with the objective.

The ISO Cybersecurity Model and the CIA Triad
=============================================

The ISO 27000 is a universal framework for every type of organization. In order to use the framework effectively, an organization must narrow down which domains, control objectives, and controls apply to its environment and operations.

The ISO 27001 control objectives serve as a checklist. The first step an organization takes is to determine if these control objectives are applicable to the organization. Most organizations generate a document called the Statement of Applicability (SOA). The SOA defines which control objectives that the organization needs to use.

Different organizations place greater priority on confidentiality, integrity, and availability depending on the type of industry. For example, Google places the highest value on user data confidentiality and availability and less on integrity. Google does not verify user data. Amazon places high emphasis on availability. If the site is not available, Amazon does not make the sale. This does not mean that Amazon ignores confidentiality in favor of availability. Amazon just places a higher priority on availability. Therefore, Amazon may spend more resources ensuring that there are more servers available to handle customer purchases.

An organization tailors its use of the available control objectives and controls to best meet its priorities with regard to confidentiality, integrity and availability.

The ISO Cybersecurity Model and the States of Data
==================================================

Different groups within an organization may be responsible for data in each of the various states. For example, the network security group is responsible for data during transmission. Programmers and data entry people are responsible for data during processing. The hardware and server support specialists are responsible for stored data. The ISO Controls specifically address security objectives for data in each of the three states.

In this example, representatives from each of the three groups help to identify the controls that are applicable and the priority of each control in their area. The representative from the network security group identifies the controls ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data transmitted.

The ISO Cybersecurity Model and Safeguards
==========================================

The ISO 27001 control objectives relate directly to the organization’s cybersecurity policies, procedures and guidelines which upper management determines. The ISO 27002 controls provide technical direction. For example, upper management establishes a policy specifying the protection of all data coming in to or out of the organization. Implementing the technology to meet the policy objectives would not involve upper management. It is the responsibility of IT professionals to properly implement and configure the equipment used to fulfill the policy directives set by upper management.
